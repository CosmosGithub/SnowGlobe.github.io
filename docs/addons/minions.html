      <div>
        <p>This minions mod can be used in many different senarios from skyblocks to factions to plain old survival as this mod has fully survival friendly recipes. Some of the minions that can be found within this mod are:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Cobblestone</h3>
        <p>The cobblestone minion will create 9 cobblestone every 20 seconds. 8 around its feet for you to mine and 1 that goes straight into its inventory.</p>
        <p>This minion can be quite useful for any builder as sometimes it can be quite inconvient to go out and mine at a cave just for some cobblestone.</p>
        <p><b>Crafting:</b> 1 Stone Pickaxe surrounded by 8 cobblestone blocks</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Coal</h3>
        <p>The coal minion will do the same as the cobblestone one in terms of amount being created as it creates 9 coal every 20 seconds.</p>
        <p>This minion is one of my top most useful minions as you can use this minion to help smelt all the other minions raw material.</p>
        <p><b>Crafting:</b> 1 Stone Pickaxe surrounded by 8 coal blocks</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Copper</h3>
        <p>The copper minion however is a bit more efficient as it creates 3 raw copper in its inventory istead of just the single one.</p>
        <p>This minion is great for use with other mods as it can create lots of copper within very little time.</p>
        <p><b>Crafting:</b> 1 Iron Pickaxe surrounded by 8 copper blocks</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Iron</h3>
        <p>The iron minion creates the same amount of iron as the cobblestone minion does cobblestone unless you have fortune in which you can mine out alot more iron than any cave could give you..</p>
        <p>This minion can be powerful for creating anything you may need from beacons, to help you mine out large areas to minecart tracks, to surround your world or even making just some good ol iron armour to help you get started.</p>
        <p><b>Crafting:</b> 1 Diamond Pickaxe surrounded by 8 iron blocks</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Gold</h3>
        <p>The gold minion similar to the iron one can create anywhere from 9 gold every 20 seconds to 36 gold every 20 seconds and thats with just one singular minion imagine having a whole factory of these.</p>
        <p>Now this minion can be quite helpful in many, like if you want mass amounts of netherite to flex on your friends you will need the gold to craft it or maybe you have a piglin farm that needs more shoping done either way this minion will help in more ways than one.</p>
        <p><b>Crafting:</b> 1 Diamond Pickaxe surrounded by 8 gold blocks</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Lapis</h3>
        <p>The lapis minion is probably one of the most efficient minions as it can drop 72 lapis every 20 seconds per minion meaning every 20 seconds you can create a new minion, AND WITH FORTUNE THAT NUMBER RISES TO A VERY IMPRESSIVE 288 EVERY 20 SECONDS.</p>
        <p>Now although the lapis minion doesnt particularly have the longest list of uses its primary use could be considered a very very important one as without our good friend lapis your Fortune 3 pickaxe isn't going to even exist.</p>
        <p><b>Crafting:</b> 1 Diamond Pickaxe surrounded by 8 Lapis blocks</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Redstone</h3>
        <p>The redstone is definitely a helpful minion for any redstone engineer who ever needs any redstone creating 45 redstone every 20 seconds.</p>
        <p>Now this minion can be very helpful to a few mischievous minecrafters who want to trap a few friends or maybe just a redstoner trying to automate every farm he can think of.</p>
        <p><b>Crafting:</b> 1 Diamond Pickaxe surrounded by 8 Redstone blocks</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Diamond</h3>
        <p>Not this minion is one of the best out there as it creates 9 diamonds every 20 seconds and a powerful 36 with fortune meaning this minion could quite easily make you one of the richest people in your server.</p>
        <p>This minion is incredibly helpful as it could allow you to get high amounts of diamonds in a very short amount of time to get enough armour for you and your entire team.</p>
        <p><b>Crafting:</b> 1 Diamond Pickaxe surrounded by 8 Diamond blocks</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Emerald</h3>
        <p>Now like the diamond minion this minion creates 9 every 20 seconds and up to 36 if you have fortune meaning anyone who is near a village would be happy to have this minion in their possesion.</p>
        <p>Now this minion can be a very powerful one due to all the different villager trades that can be used with this minion it could provide anything infinite food to infinte enchants or even STACKS UPON STACKS OF ROTTEN FLESH WOOOO.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Extras</h3>
        <p>Most of the minions have a crafting recipe how ever some do not but will have one added soon they can be seen below.</p>
