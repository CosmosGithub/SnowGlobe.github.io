        <p>This minions mod can be used in many different senarios from skyblocks to factions to plain old survival as this mod has fully survival friendly recipes. Some of the minions that can be found within this mod are:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Cobblestone</h3>
        <p>The cobblestone minion will create 9 cobblestone every 20 seconds. 8 around its feet for you to mine and 1 that goes straight into its inventory.</p>
        <p>This minion can be quite useful for any builder as sometimes it can be quite inconvient to go out and mine at a cave just for some cobblestone.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Coal</h3>
        <p>The coal minion will do the same as the cobblestone one in terms of amount being created as it creates 9 coal every 20 seconds.</p>
        <p>This minion is one of my top most useful minions as you can use this minion to help smelt all the other minions raw material.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Copper</h3>
        <p>The copper minion however is a bit more efficient as it creates 3 raw copper in its inventory istead of just the single one.</p>
        <p>This minion is great for use with other mods as it can create lots of copper within very little time.</p>
